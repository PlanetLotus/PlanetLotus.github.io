    <h3 id="new-classes">New Classes</h3>

<p>I had more fun with class hierarchy with this one. Not surprisingly, the
player’s laser gun and this enemy laser gun are pretty similar in
functionality. In addition to being moving animated sprites, they also destroy
themselves on collision with anything. The main differences are who they harm
and the frames they use (really just color!). I added a Laser class and then
made BlasterShot (Keen’s laser) and EnemyLaser inherit from Laser.</p>

<h3 id="enemylasermanager">EnemyLaserManager</h3>

<p>The more interesting concept was figuring out how best to have multiple
stationary lasers in a level and have them spawn every x seconds. Keep in mind
the gun itself has nothing to do with this; it’s just for show. The laser,
however, needs to spawn at some location periodically and travel in a
certain direction, and see if it hit Keen.</p>

<p>I created an EnemyLaserManager class that keeps a list of lasers that are
present in the level. These lasers are read in from the level data. For now it
assumes that the laser shoots downward, but this would need work in future
levels (I could add this to the level data). On each game loop,
EnemyLaserManager’s update() method is called to see if the shot
cooldown has expired and, if so, spawns another laser at each location.
For now all lasers spawn at the same time. Some levels might rely on
there being a delay between some lasers so that the player can run
underneath, but I’m not sure that exists.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-sprite-sheets">Multiple Sprite Sheets</h3>

<p>An issue I quickly ran into is that the player’s laser sprite is on a different
sprite sheet than the enemy laser sprite. The fact that there are two sprite
sheets is a flaw in itself, but it’s a bit late for fixing that to be practical
(it’s an annoyance, not a performance concern obviously). Since I batch all
lasers together in a Laser vector, their draw() method can only take one
texture but a different one is needed for BlasterShot and EnemyLaser. I fixed
this by storing a pointer to the texture in the class and not using the texture
passed into the draw() method. A long-term goal is to make this the case for
all calls to all draw() methods. I think this will result in cleaner code and
more customizability, granted it wouldn’t be a problem at all if everything was
on one sprite sheet.</p>

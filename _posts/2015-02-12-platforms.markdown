description: "A demo of bug fixes and polishing features."

I took a break for a few weeks from this project and just this last week I've
really gotten back into it. Since my last post I've fixed many more bugs that
were a result from making the physics framerate-independent, fixed
long-standing pole climbing bugs, added slope movement for enemy units, and,
maybe most significantly, brought moving platforms into the level for real
this time.

The video below demonstrates a lot of new things that I've had since my last
post but didn't make a video for, such as the new speed values Keen has
(everything moves much faster now!) and more stability in general, as well as
the things above that I just mentioned. There's still quite a bit to do even
for some of these new features, such as platforms, but this still marks a
worthy milestone in making the game actually look like a game.

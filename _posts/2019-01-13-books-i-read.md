Up to eleven in 2018, which surprised me. I focused more on books about money/investing which I was really into.

What's Worth Reading?
---------------------

Read **The Five Levels of Leadership** if you have any interest in management. This is one of the better books I've read about management, I think because it guides you through the management career ladder and gives specific, concrete advice for each step. Even if you never intend to reach the higher levels in the book, it still tells you what you should expect of the person you report to in that position.

Read **The Little Book of Bulletproof Investing** if you want to dive a little deeper into your 401(k), but don't want to spend your whole life studying. If you haven't done much reading on the subject before, be sure to take it all with a grain of salt, because everyone has their own strong opinion on how to get rich from investing. Still, if you approach it with a critical mind, you'll take away some solid lessons, and confirm what you already thought you knew.

Read **What Every Body is Saying** if you want to understand a little science behind observing people. A lot of the lessons in the book are intuitive to most people, but it's the first time most of those observations have been explained to me with scientific backing. Like other books, it helps confirm what you already think, but also gives you some more to think about while interacting with people.

What's Next?
------------

In 2019 so far, I'm halfway through **The Manager's Path**. So far, it reminds me of **The Five Levels of Leadership** but much more geared toward development. It's quickly becoming my new favorite management book and I think I will continue to reference it for years.

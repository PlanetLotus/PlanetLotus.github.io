<p>I took the last month or so off to work on a <a href="https://github.com/PlanetLotus/UnityRTSTutorial">3D RTS
Tutorial</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/PlanetLotus/UnityMultiplayerFPSTutorial">3D FPS
Tutorial</a>. My
attention is somewhat shifting toward 3D development now since it’s new and
exciting, but I do want to make this game a little more complete first. My goal
is to get done with the first level and call that a “complete”
project. I’m not sure yet exactly how many features the first level will have,
but my emphasis is on learning, so if there’s a minor feature that I don’t
think will contribute to my learning, I may not do it. This includes (as
you’ll see soon) things like filling in the black spaces in the
edge background tiles. I’d have to add a bunch of hand-edited tiles to the
spritesheet. Not exactly high on my priority list.</p>

<p>There’s not a whole lot of new programming concepts to talk about here (it’s
mostly more of the same work done in my last post), so I think the main
thing will be the video demo to show the progress. I’ve added background tiles,
units, and items to the map. Prior to this, my game had no concept of a
collectible item, so that functionality is still a work-in-progress.</p>

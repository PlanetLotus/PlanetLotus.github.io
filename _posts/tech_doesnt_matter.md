A common communication issue I see between development and non-technical leadership ("your boss" from now on) is that development will argue on the basis of a particular technology. They don't care.

# The good news

The good news is, your boss ought to care that you're passionate about tech, even if they can't relate. This has its place and can be an asset. When you're starting a new project and evaluating different technical solutions, showing your expertise in certain products and being able to weigh the pros and cons is a huge benefit to your company. The bad news is, your passion can get in the way in other discussions.

# On the other hand...

There are many more situations where caring too much about the tech will lead you astray in a discussion with your boss. If your boss has worked with developers for awhile, they're going to recognize certain statements and immediately discount your opinion unless it's approached carefully. Some examples:

* "We need to rewrite project X in language Y"
* "We should build the new project in [language we've never used before]"
* "We need to update to the latest version of X. It'll take weeks."

All of these topics do have their place, but chances are, another developer has already ruined that statement for your boss before you said it. They're all going to be an uphill battle to get prioritized and you'll have to be careful in how you articulate their importance.

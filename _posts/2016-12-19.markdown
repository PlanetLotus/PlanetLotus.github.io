This is mostly for me, so I can look back on what I've read and see how much I read each year.

1. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
2. (I'm forgetting one here...WHAT WAS IT CALLED?!?!)
3. Growth Hacker Marketing
4. Lean Analytics
5. The Thank You Economy
6. David and Goliath
7. The Innovator's Dilemma
8. Delivering Happiness
9. Platform Revolution
10. Monetizing Innovation

Looks like I got through 10 books this year, though I didn't finish David and
Goliath, and Growth Hacker Marketing was very short. I hope to do even better
next year, but as someone who really doesn't like reading, I'm
pretty happy that I got through this many.

What's Worth Reading?
---------------------

Of the 10 I read, here are the ones I'd recommend to developers working in or interested in startups:

Read **Lean Analytics** if you want a step-by-step guide on how to launch a product
in your new startup. It helped me realize we're skipping some steps, but also
that this is pretty common.

Read **The Innovator's Dilemma** if you want a bunch of examples of how companies
have disrupted industries in the recent past. Learn the real definition of
disruption, not the overused version we have today.

Read **Delivering Happiness** if you want a feel-good success story about treating
people the right way and actually coming out on top from it.

Read **Monetizing Innovation** to realize that you forgot a crucial step that was
mentioned in Lean Analytics, and for a lot of detail about what someone in your
position can do about it. That said, leave it to the pros - you should probably
hire someone else to do the job. But at least now you know you're missing an
entire department in your company.

I'd recommend **Platform Revolution** to people not involved in development,
but I think the concepts are pretty obvious to people in dev. It just puts
some vocabulary on top of it and makes you think about it more than you
otherwise might.

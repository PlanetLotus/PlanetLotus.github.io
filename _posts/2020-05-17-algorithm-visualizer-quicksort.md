# Quicksort in Unity

For the second algorithm to animate, I chose quicksort. I figured quicksort would be less work than implementing a binary search tree, while also proving challenging to animate. It did. I think the animation is still pretty unclear unless you already know how quicksort works, so this needs work, and I may come back to it in the future. Until then, I'm planning on moving onto binary search trees for the next data structure.

# Demo

This demo shows the entire animation of sorting 10 numbers.

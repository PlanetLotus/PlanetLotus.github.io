Quick thought exercise: How would you prototype games that already exist? The
idea here is to get a better idea for myself how I should go about prototyping
my own game ideas.  To me, one of the most important parts of prototyping is
coming up with a short list of questions to answer. The questions, ideally, are
more objective than subjective but this is often difficult because you might be
trying to test whether a certain mechanic is “fun”, rather than whether it’s
technically possible to create. Coming up with these questions is hard, so I
thought I'd practice on games that turned out very successful.

Different game genres will require different prototypes and vary in complexity
as well. For this post, first I came up with a list of genres. Then, a couple
of popular games for each genre. Last, I tried to think of the core mechanics
for each game and what questions I would try to answer to prototype the
mechanics.

Do you have better questions for any of my examples below? If so, leave a comment.

Arcade
----

Pong
====

- Can I make controls that feel good for the player?
- Can I make an AI that doesn’t win easily but isn’t useless either?
- Can I make unrealistic but compelling physics for the ball?

Space Invaders
====

- Can I make it increasingly difficult but not impossible to fend off waves of enemies that descend toward the player?
- What’s a good number of enemies per level?
- How fast should the enemies move?

Tetris
====

- Can I make the pieces rotate while they fall (and “feel good” controls)?
- Will "random" pieces make it possible for the player to win indefinitely?
- Is falling speed a good difficulty progression?
- Is it satisfying to clear a row or multiple rows at once?

Traditional Platformer
-----

Super Mario Bros
====

- Can I invent physics that aid gameplay and aren’t frustrating?
- Is jumping on an enemy simple enough for the player to be a common part of gameplay?

Commander Keen 4
====

- Is it fun to shoot enemies rather than jump on them?
- What kinds of levels can I create with the addition of the pogo stick? Is it significantly different than just jumping and climbing?
- Does the ability to hang from ledges make the physics less frustrating?

First-Person Shooter
-----

Doom
====

- Can a mouse be used to aim and shoot multiple enemies on screen quickly?
- Should we allow the player to be hit once or multiple times without dying? Can he heal?
- Are different enemy types a good difficulty progression? What about different weapons?

Counter-Strike
====

- Can I create a compelling realistic shooter?
- Can I use different weapon types in the same game and have a balanced game?
- Should the current weapon affect movement speed?
- Should the player have access to all weapons, or have to unlock them somehow?
- What if movement speed changed accuracy?

Call of Duty 4
====

- Is it viable to pursue killstreak unlocks? How many killstreaks should there be?
- Can I create a balanced game where different players use different classes?
- What if your stance (stand, crouch, prone) changed accuracy?
- What if I could see other players on a radar?
- Can different game modes other than deathmatch be used on the same map?

Real-Time Strategy
-----

Starcraft
====

- Can I create a compelling AI when there are so many decisions to make?
- Should I create multiple races to choose from or just one?
- Can I achieve a balanced game while also keeping it interesting and more complex than Rock Paper Scissors?

(For something as complex as Starcraft, there were probably many prototyped ideas)

RPG
-----

Pokemon
====

- Can I make a turn-based fighting scene fun and strategic?
- Do I feel compelled to catch as many unique Pokemon as I can?

Diablo II
====

- Can I use the mouse to both fight and move?
- What kinds of stats should the player have?
- Is grinding for experience and items fun?

Casual
-----

Stardew Valley
====

- Should the dungeon be procedurally generated?\*
- Is it fun to care for the crops?
- Do I feel rewarded from exploring and talking to other NPCs?

\* I've read about SV being created. This was originally part of the design and was cut out.

Conclusions
--------

After this exercise, I learned that I came up with two basic types of questions:

- Is this mechanic viable? Does the player like using it?
- Should I do this OR that?

I'm not sure if these are actually the right types of questions to ask, and I
still found it pretty challenging to come up with good questions for
well-established games, especially for the more complicated games.

As I filled in questions for more games, I actually got less confident that I
was asking the right questions. I'm still questioning whether my approach to
prototyping is right. I'm used to working within a lot of constraints and
finding a solution. Finding the constraints is definitely a different way of
thinking and I imagine will take lots of practice.

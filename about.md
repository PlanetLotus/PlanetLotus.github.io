I'm in the process of writing new posts for this blog that are not connected to
my old project. I haven't figured out how best to organize this in GitHub Pages
(moving old posts to a gh-pages branch on the project doesn't sound like a fun
weekend project) so this is definitely a work-in-progress as I figure out what
I want to do with it. In the meantime, just think of this as a tech blog where
I occasionally write about things I find interesting.

### Old: My Commander Keen 5 Learning Experience

This project is no longer under active development. I spent about a year on it
in my spare time fairly consistently, occasionally taking a few weeks off. I
decided to stop when I ran into significant diminishing returns with my
learning. I ended with a fairly complete first level (minus sound and music).
Next would've been save/load features and more levels, but the only thing I was
really looking forward to with more levels is adding more enemy types. I ended
up moving on to other projects.

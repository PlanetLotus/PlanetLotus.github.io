{"name":"Planetlotus.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### Introducing My Commander Keen 5 Clone\r\n\r\nI have a project under active development. As noted in its [repo](https://github.com/PlanetLotus/keen5-linux), the main goals of this project are to practice C++ and OOP (and have fun doing it). Provided it doesn't take away from development time too much, I'd like to start blogging about my progress. I found a nifty screen capture program called [recordMyDesktop](http://sourceforge.net/projects/recordmydesktop/) which gave me some hope that this isn't too painful to accomplish.\r\n\r\nGiven that I'm already ~9 months into development as of the time of this writing, a lot of awesome development, bugs, and learning has gone undocumented except in the form of commits. I'm hoping to address the highlights of each feature with a short demo clip and short blog post.\r\n\r\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Commander_Keen_in_Goodbye_Galaxy_title_screen.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
